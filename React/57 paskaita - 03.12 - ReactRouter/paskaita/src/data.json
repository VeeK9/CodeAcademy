      "description": "Purchase an asparagus fern, and you'll find that it can handle much more abuse than its counterparts. That's because it's really not a fern after all. Asparagus setaceus can thrive in bright spaces as well as corners with very little light. Keep this fluffy plant's soil moist at all times. Take note: This plant is toxic to cats and dogs."
